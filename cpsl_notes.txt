flex will recognize "0x" as an integer next to an identifier. This is not a lexical error, but it is a syntax error. 
  Also, using atoi() is the best way to convert strings to integers. 

Note on flex files: %% separates the sections of the flex file. 


Example Flex file


%%

//
do|DO {return DO_TOKEN;} //Keyword example: Whatever is in the curly braces is the code that the scanner generator drops in its code. 
[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]* {yylval.stuff = ;yytext  return ID_TOKEN;} //Identifier example. This is kinda tricky. 
'+' {return ADDITION_TOKEN;} //Operator example. Quotes used to delimit + 


%%
