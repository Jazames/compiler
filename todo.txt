Checkpoint 1: parser and scanner: 

List of things to do to make it work:

Create regular expressions for keywords
Create regular expressions for operators
Create regular expressions for identifiers
Create regular expressions for everything else

Create context free grammar rules for language rules.
  There's a lot to this one, but I don't know what.

Create symbol table? 




---------------------------------------------
Day 3: 

It is reatsonable to write out all of the necessary regular expressions this weekend. So attempt to do that. 
  Not necessary to write all the associated code, just the regexes. Possibly put cout statements? 


---------------------------------------------
Day 1:
Tools used to make this compiler:


gcc 7.3

flex 2.6 //Might update version? 

bison 3.0.4

cmake 3.9

Mars 4.5 //This is the MIPS simulator. Everything else can be obtained with apt-get. This is a little harder.
